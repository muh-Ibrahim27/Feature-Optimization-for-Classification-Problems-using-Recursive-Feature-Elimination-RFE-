# Feature-Optimization-for-Classification-Problems-using-Recursive-Feature-Elimination-RFE-
This project improves a classification model by optimizing its feature set using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) on the Titanic dataset. It identifies the most important features for survival prediction and compares model performance before and after feature reduction.
